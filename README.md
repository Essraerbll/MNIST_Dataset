# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition (PyTorch)

This project implements a simple **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for handwritten digit classification using the **MNIST** dataset. The model is trained, evaluated, and the results are visualized through loss/accuracy graphs and sample predictions.
